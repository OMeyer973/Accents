## How to have Accents run automatically when I start my PC ?

- [Download Accents](https://github.com/OMeyer973/Accents/archive/master.zip), extract the content
- Press Win+R to open the Run dialog, then enter shell:startup and click OK. This will open the Startup folder for the current user.
- coppy Accent.exe and paste a shortcut in the Startup folder (right click > paste shortcut). Any program linked in this folder will start automatically on startup.
- that's it !
